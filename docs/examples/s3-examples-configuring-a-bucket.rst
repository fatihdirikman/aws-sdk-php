=============================
Configuring Amazon S3 Buckets
=============================

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support in Amazon S3, you can build rich client-side web applications with Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross-origin access to your Amazon S3 resources.

For more information about using CORS configuration with an Amazon S3 bucket, see `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html>`_.
