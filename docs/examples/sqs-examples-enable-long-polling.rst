===================================
Enabling Long Polling in Amazon SQS
===================================

Long polling reduces the number of empty responses by allowing Amazon SQS to wait a specified time for a message to become available in the queue before sending a response. Also, long polling eliminates false empty responses by querying all of the servers instead of a sampling of servers. To enable long polling, you must specify a non-zero wait time for received messages. To learn more, see `Amazon SQS Long Polling <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html>`_.
