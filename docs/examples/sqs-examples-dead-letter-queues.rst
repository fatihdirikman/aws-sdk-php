======================================
Using Dead Letter Queues in Amazon SQS
======================================

A dead letter queue is one that other (source) queues can target for messages that can't be processed successfully. You can set aside and isolate these messages in the dead letter queue to determine why their processing did not succeed. You must individually configure each source queue that sends messages to a dead letter queue. Multiple queues can target a single dead letter queue.
